# Running

This project has a preconfigured run configuration: `run`.

Running the configuration `run` requires two IntelliJ plugins: `Texify Idea` and `PDF Viewer`. <br>
`Texify Idea` requires some `LaTex` runtime to be installed.

The generated pdf can be found in `out`.

Additionally, installing `SyncTex` automatically enables jumping to source and vice versa.
