%TODO Add Possible future work and improvements

In the future, the PiRover can be extended with new hardware and improved functionality. Some possible ideas are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Adding more hardware} \\
    The rover can be equipped with additional components like a second camera on the back (rear view camera) or an ultrasonic distance sensor. These would help with better navigation and safety.

    \item \textbf{Autonomous driving} \\
    The software can be extended to detect lines or paths using the camera. This would allow the rover to drive on its own by following a line on the ground.
\end{itemize}
